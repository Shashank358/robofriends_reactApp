# robofriends_reactApp
This  is the first react app I have created. I've created this app when I was learning the React first time. There are some cool features like API call from url and search by name.

To make this app working add following lines
1. Open cmd in windows or terminal if you are in Mac.
2. type "npx create-react-app appName" in cmd
3. copy all the files from github and paste into the react app.
4. go to the directory of reactApp.
5. type "npm run start" in cmd.
6. Open browser......here we go.
